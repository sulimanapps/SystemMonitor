## Maker Comment

Hi Product Hunt!

I built SystemMonitor Pro because I was tired of paying $90/year for CleanMyMac just to check my CPU temperature and clean some caches.

This app does everything those premium apps do:
- Real-time system monitoring
- Cache cleaning
- App uninstalling
- Large file finder

And it's 100% free and open source. No subscriptions, no trials, no ads.

Built natively with SwiftUI, it's lightweight (~700KB) and uses minimal resources.

Would love your feedback!
